            <h1>Suddenly Everywhere</h1>
            <p id="byline">by Leah Welch</p>
            <p>In the ongoing Television vs. Movies debate, it is common to see celebrations of the current "Golden Age of Television" alongside commiserations about the decreased quality and recycled material of contemporary cinema. While the existence of online streaming networks blurs the line between television and movies, there is still an undeniable spectacle associated with seeing a movie on the big screen.</p>
            <p>Movie stars are part of that spectacle: larger-than-life figures whose presence in hit movies with high production value aid in the transportative experience of going to the cinema. Even if actors appearing in critically acclaimed series provide better performances of more compelling dialogue, it is hard to detach the notion of "stardom" from top-billed actors in blockbuster films.</p>
            <p>Every movie star had to get their start somewhere, and television roles figure prominently in many stars' early careers. While many of those instances feature roles that the actors would sooner not relive, some television roles were so critical to an actor's exposure that they actually launched that person's entire film career. Suddenly they're everywhere.</p>
