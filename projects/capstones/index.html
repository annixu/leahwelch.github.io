            <h1>The Path to Sustainable Fashion</h1>
            <p>I reverse-engineered Giorgia Lupi’s 2017 MoMA installation Capstones to examine the impact of the fashion industry on sustainability.</p>
            <p>Capstones charts the progress of 8 fashion items toward meeting the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals across 15 Areas of Impact that form the commercial life cycle of a product.</p>
            <p>Evaluating Capstones as a high-level snapshot of common practices by large apparel and footwear companies, I extracted the relationships between Areas of Impact (industries) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for each item.</p>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <p>Retail spaces, marketing campaigns, influencers, and consumers are an under-utilized resource in current sustainability efforts.</p>
            <p>Especially consumers.</p>
            <p>We don’t have enough information yet to effect change through our purchasing power.</p> 
            <p>Consumers need a standardized metric by which to evaluate the ethics and sustainable practices of the companies responsible for clothing us.</p>
            <p>If we all start asking questions of our retailers about how their products are designed, sourced, manufactured, and transported, we can exert pressure on the industry to embrace a more transparent model.</p>
