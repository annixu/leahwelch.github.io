                <p>As an initial exploration into the curious drabness of menswear, I inspected and compared shared apparel categories in Zara's Men's and Women's Autumn-Winter 2019 Collections.</p>

                <h2>Why Zara?</h2>
                <p>Zara works well as an initial case study due to both its data and its market share. Zara's color data is simple to select directly from their eCommerce site and limited in scope. As a fast-fashion brand that does not specifically target certain ages or lifestyles, Zara's market share is broad, encapsulating anyone both fashionable and price-conscious.</p>
